Therapist,Good morning.
Patient,"Hello, Doctor Rogers"
Therapist,"I'm Doctor Rogers, you must be Gloria."
Patient,"Yes, I am."
Therapist,"Won't you have a chair? Now then, we have half an hour together, and I really don't know what we will be able to make of it but uh I hope we can make something of it. I'd be glad to know whatever concerns you."
Patient,"Well, right now I'm nervous but I feel more comfortable the way you are talking in a low voice and I don't feel like you'll be so harsh on me. But, ah ..."
Therapist,I hear the tremor in your voice so I know you are...
Patient,"Uh, well, the main thing I um, want to talk to you about is uh, I'm just newly divorced and uh I had gone in therapy before and I felt comfortable when I left, and all of a sudden now the biggest change is adjusting to my single life. And uh one of the things that bothers me the most is especially men, and having men to the house and how it affects the children and- Uh, the biggest thing I want - the thing that keeps coming to my mind I want to tell you about is that I have a daughter, nine, who at one time I felt had a lot of emotional problems. I wish I could stop shaking, hahaha."
Therapist,hahaha
Patient,"And uh, I'm real conscious of things affecting her. I don't want her to get upset, I don't want to shock her. I want so bad to- for her to accept me. And we're real open with each other especially about sex. And the other day she saw a girl that was single but pregnant and she asked me all about ""can girls get pregnant if they are single?"" And the conversation was fine and I wasn’t un- at ease at all with her until she asked me if I had ever made love to a man since I left her daddy and I lied to her. And ever since that, it keeps coming up to my mind because I feel so guilty lying to her because I never lie and I want her to trust me. And I want- I almost want an answer from you. I want you to tell me if it would affect her wrong if I told her the truth, or what."
Therapist,"And it's this concern about her and the fact that you really aren't - that this open relationship that has existed between you, now you feel it's kind of vanished?"
Patient,"Yes. I feel like I have to be on guard about that because I remember when I was a little girl, when I first found out my mother and father made love, that was dirty and terrible, and I didn't- I didn’t like her any more for awhile. And I don't want to lie to Pammy either and I don't know..."
Therapist,I sure wish I could give you the answer as to what you should tell her. I was afraid you were going to say that hahaha.
Therapist,Because what you really want is an answer.
Patient,I want to especially know if it would affect her if I was completely honest and open with her or if it would affect her because I lied. I feel like it is bound to make a strain because I lied to her. [Words lost]
Therapist,"Mhm. You feel she'll suspect that, or she'll know something is not quite right?"
Patient,"I feel that in time she will distrust me, yes. And also I thought well, gee, what about when she gets a little older and she finds herself in touchy situations. She probably wouldn't want to admit it to me because she thinks I'm so good and so sweet. And yet I'm afraid she could think I'm really a- a devil. And I want so bad for her to accept me. And I don't know how much a nine-year-old can take."
Therapist,And really both alternatives concern you. That she may think you're too good or better than you really are.
Patient,Yes.
Therapist,And she may think you are worse than you are.
Patient,Not worse than I am. I don't know if she can accept me the way I am. I think I paint a picture that I'm all sweet and motherly. And -- I'm a little ashamed of my shady side too.
Therapist,"I see. It really cuts a little deeper. If she really knew you, would she, could she accept you?"
Patient,This is what I don't know. Yeah. I don't want her to turn away from me.
Therapist,that relationship-
Patient,"And I don't even know how I feel about it because there are times when I feel so guilty like when I have a man over, I even try to make a special set-up so that if I were ever alone with him, the children would never catch me in that sort of thing. Because I'm real leery about it. And yet I also know that I have these desires."
Therapist,"And so it’s quite clear it isn't only her problem or the relationship with her, it's in you as well."
Patient,And my guilt. Yeah. Yeah. I feel guilty so often.
Therapist,"""What- What can I accept myself as doing?"" And uh"
Patient,"Yes, Yes"
Therapist,"you realize that you set up sort of subterfuges, so as to make sure that you're not caught or something, you realize that you are acting from guilt, is that it?"
Patient,"Yes and I don't like the ... I would like to feel comfortable with whatever I do. If I choose not to tell Pammy the truth, to feel comfortable that she can handle it, and I don't. I want to be honest, and yet I feel there are some areas that I don't even accept."
Therapist,"And if you can't accept them in yourself, how could you possibly be comfortable in telling them to her?"
Patient,Right.
Therapist,"Mhm. Mhm. And yet, as you say, you do have these desires and you do have your feelings, but- but you don't feel good about them."
Patient,"Right. And I, I, I have a feeling that you are just going to sit there and let me stew in it haha and I- I want more. I want you to help me get rid of my guilt feeling. If I can get rid of my guilt feeling about lying or going to bed with a single man, any of that, just so I can feel more comfortable."
Therapist,"Mhm. And I guess I'd like to say, ""No, I don't want to let you stew in your feelings,"" but on the other hand, I, I also feel that this is the kind of very private thing that I couldn't possibly answer for you. But I sure as anything will try to help you work toward your own answer. I don't know whether that makes any sense to you, but I mean it."
Patient,"Well, I appreciate you saying that. You sound like you mean it. But I don't know where to go. I don't begin to know where to go. I thought that I had pretty well worked over most of my guilt, and now that this is coming up I'm disappointed in myself. I really am. I want- I like it when I feel that no matter what I do, even if it's against my own morals or my upbringing, that I can still feel good about me. And now I don't. Like uh, there's a girl at work who sort of mothers me and she just- she- I think she thinks I'm all sweet, and I sure don't want to show my more ornery devilish side with her. I want to be sweet and it's so hard for me to - this all seems so new again and it's so disappointing."
Therapist,"Yeah, I get the disappointment - that here, a lot of these things you’d thought you'd worked through, and now the guilts and the feeling that only a part of you is acceptable to anybody else."
Patient,Yes.
Therapist,"That keeps coming out. I guess I do catch the real deep puzzlement that you feel as to ""What the hell shall I do? What can I do?"""
Patient,"Yes, and do you know what I can find, doctor, is that everything I start to do that I st- impulsive, seems natural to tell Pammy, or- or to go out on a date or something, I’m comfortable until I think how I was affected as a child and the minute that comes up, then I'm all haywire. Like uh, I want to be a good mother so bad, and I feel like I am a good mother, but then there's those little exceptions. Like my guilts with working. I want to work and it's so fun having extra money. I like to work nights. The minute I think I'm not being real good to the children or giving them enough time, then I start feeling guilty again. Then, that’s when I- it’s uh- what do they call it? A double bind. That's just what it feels like. I want to do this and it feels right, but after all I'm not being a good mother and I want to be both. I am becoming more and more aware of what a perfectionist I am. That is what it seems I want to be so perfect. Either I want to become perfect in my standards, or not have that need any more."
Therapist,"Or, I guess I hear it a little differently - that uh- what you want is to seem perfect, but it means it’s- a great- a matter of great importance to you to be a good mother and you want to seem to be a good mother, even if some of your actual feelings differ from that. Is that catching it or not?"
Patient,"Gee, I don't feel like I am saying that."
Therapist,"Oh, okay"
Patient,"No, that isn't what I feel, really. I want to approve of me always, but my actions won't let me. I want to approve of me. I – I think-"
Therapist,"I realize ... you -- alright, but let me -- I’d like to understand it. You sound as though your actions were kind of outside of you. You want to approve of you, but what you do somehow won't let you approve of yourself."
Patient,"Right. Like I feel that I can't approve of myself regarding, for example haha, my sex life. This is the big thing. If I really fell in love with a man and I respected him and I adored him, I don't think I would feel so guilty going to bed with him and I don't think I would have to make up any excuses to the children because they could see my natural caring for him."
Therapist,"Mhm, Okay"
Patient,"But when I have the physical desires and I'll say, ""Oh well, why not,"" and I want to anyway, but I feel guilty afterwards. I hate facing the kids, I don't like looking at myself, and I rarely enjoy it. And this is what I mean. If the circumstances would be different, I don't think I'd feel so guilty because I'd feel right about it."
Therapist,"Yeah, I- I guess I hear you saying, ""If what I was doing, when I went to bed with a man, was really genuine and full of love and respect and so on, I wouldn't feel guilty in relation to Pam. I wouldn’t uh, I, I really would be comfortable about the situation."""
Patient,"That's how I feel, yeah, haha. And I know that sounds like I want a perfect situation, but that is how I feel. And in the meantime, I can't stop these desires. I tried that also. I’ve tried saying, ""O.K., I don't like myself when I do that so I won't do it any more."" But then I resent the children. I think, why should they stop me from doing what I want, and it is really not that bad."
Therapist,"But I guess I heard you saying too, that it isn't only the children, but you don't like it as well when it isn't really ..."
Patient,"Right. I'm sure that - I know that's it, probably even more so than I'm aware of. But I only notice it so much when I pick it up in the children. Then I can also notice it in myself."
Therapist,"And somehow, sometimes, you kind of uh, feel like blaming them for the feelings you have. I mean, why should they cut you out from a normal sex life, huh?"
Patient,"Well, a sex life, I could say, not normal because there is something about me that says that's not very healthy – to uh just go into sex because you feel physically attracted or something, or a physical need. So, something about it tells me that that's not quite right anyway."
Therapist,"Mhm. But you feel, really, that at times you’re acting in ways that are not in accord with your own inner standards."
Patient,Right. Right.
Therapist,"But then you were also saying, a minute ago, that you feel you can't help that uh- either."
Patient,"I wish I could. That's it, and I can't - now I feel like I- I can't control myself as well as I could have before. For a specific reason now, I can't. I just let go and I have- there’s too many things I do wrong that I have to feel guilty for, and I sure don't like that. I want you very much to give me a direct answer, and I'm going to ask it, and I don't expect a direct answer, haha, but I want to know. Do you feel that - to me the most important thing is to be open and honest and if I can be open and honest with my children, do you feel that it could harm them? If for example, I could say to Pammy, ""I was- I felt bad lying to you, Pammy, and I want to tell you the truth now,"" and if I tell her the truth and she’s shocked at me and she’s upset, that that could bother her more? I was- I want to get rid of my guilts and that will help me, but I don't want to put ‘em on her."
Therapist,That's right.
Patient,Do you feel that that could hurt her?
Therapist,"That’s a real concern. I guess uh - I am sure this will sound evasive to you, but it seems to me that perhaps the person you are not being uh fully honest with is you?"
Patient,Sure
Therapist,"Because I was very much struck by the fact that you were saying, ""If I feel all right about what I have done, whether it's going to bed with a man or what, if I really feel all right about it, then I do not have any concern about what I would tell Pam or my relationship with her."""
Patient,"Right. All right. Now I hear what you are sayin’, sigh. Then all right, then I want to work on"
Therapist,"It’s kind of tough, huh?"
Patient,"I wanna work on accepting me, then. I want to work on feeling all right about it. But that makes sense. That that will come natural and then I won't have to worry about Pammy. But when things do seem so wrong for me and I have an impulse to do them, how can I accept that?"
Therapist,What you'd like to do is to feel more accepting toward yourself when you do things that you feel are wrong. Is that right?
Patient,"Right. And I feel like, I feel like..."
Therapist,It sounds like a tough assignment.
Patient,"Yeah, I feel like you are going to say, ""Now why do you think they’re wrong?"" and uh, I have mixed feelings there too. Through therapy I will say, ""Now look, I know this is natural. Women feel it - sure, we don't talk about it lots socially but all women feel it and it's very natural."" I have had sex for the last 11 years and I’m- of course going to want it, but I still think it is wrong unless you’re really, truly in love with a man, and my body doesn't seem to agree. And so I don't know how to accept it."
Therapist,"It sounds like a triangle to me, isn't it? You feel that I, or therapists in general, or other people say, ""It is all right, it is all right, it’s natural enough, go ahead."" Um, and I guess you feel your body sort of lines up on that side of the picture. But something in you says, ""But I don't like it that way, not unless it’s really right."""
Patient,"Right. Sigh, well, I have a hopeless feeling. I mean, these are all the things that I sort of feel myself, and I feel uh - O.K., now what?"
Therapist,"Mhm. You feel this is the conflict and it's just insoluble, and therefore it is hopeless, and here you look to me and I don't seem to give you any help and that uh-"
Patient,"Right. I uh- I really know you can't answer for me, and I have to figure it out myself, but I want you to guide me or show me where to start or - so it won't look so hopeless. I know I can keep living with this conflict and I know eventually things would work out, but I'd like feeling more comfortable with the way I live – and I'm not."
Therapist,"One thing I might ask, what is it you wish I would say to you?"
Patient,"I wish you would say to me: to be honest and take the risk that Pammy’s going to accept me. And I also have a feeling if I could really risk it with Pammy, of all people, that I'd be able to say, ""Here's this little kid that can accept me, and I'm really not that bad."" If she really knows what a demon I am and still loves me and accepts me, it seems like it would help me to accept me more - like it's really not that bad. I want you to say to go ahead and be honest, but I don't want the responsibility that it would upset her."
Therapist,I see.
Patient,That is where I don't want to take responsibility.
Therapist,"So you know, yeah - You know very well what you'd like to do in the relationship. You would like to be yourself and you'd like to have her know that you're not perfect and do things that maybe even she wouldn't approve of, and that you disapprove of to some degree yourself, but that uh- somehow she would love you and accept you as an imperfect person."
Patient,"Yes. Like I wonder if my mother had been more open with me, maybe I wouldn't have had such a narrow attitude about sex. If I would have thought that she could be, you know, pretty sexy and ornery, and devilish too, that I wouldn't look at her as being such a sweet mother, that she could also be the other side. But she didn't talk about that. Maybe that's where I got my picture. I don't know, but I want Pammy to see me as a full woman, but also accept me."
Therapist,You don't sound so uncertain.
Patient,I don't? What do you mean?
Therapist,What I mean is you have been sitting there telling me just what you would like to do in that relationship with Pam.
Patient,"I would, but I don't want to quite take the risk of doing it"
Therapist,I can understand
Patient,unless an authority tells me that ...
Therapist,"It’s, I guess one thing that I feel very keenly is that it's an awful risky thing to live. You'd be taking a chance on your relationship with her and taking a chance on letting her know who you are, really."
Patient,"Yeah. But then if I don't take the chance, if I feel loved and accepted by her, I'll never feel good about it anyway."
Therapist,"Mhm. Mhm. If her love and acceptance of you is based on a false picture of you, what the hell is the good of that? Is that- is that what you are saying?"
Patient,"Yeah, that’s what I mean, yes. But I also feel there is a lot of responsibility with being a mother. With I don’t- I don't want to feel like I have caused any big traumas in the children. I don't like all that responsibility. I think that's it. I don't like it, feeling it could be my fault."
Therapist,"Mhm. I guess that's what I meant when I said, ""Life is risky."" It’s uh- to take the responsibility for being the person you would like to be with her is a hell of a responsibility."
Patient,It is.
Therapist,A very frightening one.
Patient,"And you know, I- I look at it two ways. I like to see myself as being so honest with the kids, and really being proud of myself so that no matter what I told them or no matter how bad they think I was, I was honest and down deep it’s gonna be a much more wholesome relationship, and yet you know, I get jealous of like when they are with their daddy. I feel he’s more flip, he’s not quite as real, he’s not quite as honest, but nevertheless, they see a sweet picture of their dad. You know, he is all goodness and light, and I am envious of that too. I want them to see me just as sweet as they see him and yet I know he is not quite as real with them. So it seems like I've got to swap the one for the other, and I know this is really what I want the most, but uh, I miss some of that glory."
Therapist,"Yeah. You sort of feel, “I want them to have just as nice a picture of me as they have of their dad,"
Patient,I do. Right
Therapist,"and if his is a little phony, then maybe mine will have to be too.” I think that's putting it a little too strongly, but-"
Patient,"But that’s close. That is what I mean. So uh- But I know she can't have that neat a picture of me, if I were honest. haha"
Therapist,hahaha
Patient,"Besides that, I do feel that I’m a little more ornery than their dad anyway. So I'm likely to do more things that they’d disapprove of."
Therapist,Sounds like you really find it quite hard to believe that they would really love you if they knew you?
Patient,"That's right. You know that's exactly it. Before therapy, I would have definitely chosen the other area. I’m going to get respect from them no matter what - even if I have to lie."
Therapist,I see.
Patient,"But right now, I know that's not true and I'm not positive they'll truly accept me. Something tells me they will. I know they will, but I am not positive. I want reassurance. I keep wanting these things."
Therapist,"And now you are kind of in a no-man's-land of probably shifting from one point of view toward them to another, but boy you'd sure like somebody to say, ""That's right, you go ahead and do it."""
Patient,"Yes. Yes. That's why I get encouraged when I read in a book from somebody I respect and admire, that this is the right thing no matter what - honesty will win out. Well then, that keeps giving me confidence. “By gosh, I'm right.” But I ..."
Therapist,"It is so damned hard to really choose something on your own, isn't it?"
Patient,"Which makes me feel rea- very immature. I don't like this in me. I wish I were grown up enough or mature enough to make my decisions and stick by them, but I need somebody to help me on - somebody to push me."
Therapist,"So that you kind of reproach yourself for that, I guess. And feel, ""Why, if I was anybody, or if I was grown up, I'd be mature enough to decide things like this for myself."""
Patient,"Right. Right. And take more risks. I wish I’d take more risks. I wish that I could just go ahead and be this and say, however the children grow up, I've done my best. I didn’t have to constantly have this conflict. And I'd like, in later years, to say, ""No matter what you asked me kids, at least I told you the truth. You may not have liked it, but it's been the truth."" That, somehow, I can admire. I- I disrespect people that lie. I hate it so, you see what a double bind I am in. I hate myself if I'm bad, but I also hate myself if I lie. So uh, it's accepting. I want to become more accepting."
Therapist,"I guess, judging from your tone of voice, you sound as though you hate yourself more when you lie than you do in terms of things you disapprove of in behavior."
Patient,"I do. I do because this has really bothered me. This happened with Pammy about a month ago and it keeps coming to my mind. I don't know whether to go back and talk to her about it or wait. She may have even forgotten what she asked me, but uh – it just-"
Therapist,"The point is, you haven't forgotten."
Patient,"I haven... No, I haven't. And I would like, at least, to be able to tell her that I remember lying and I am sorry I lied and it has been driving me bugs because I did. I do- Now I feel like - now that's solved - and I didn't even solve a thing, but I feel relieved. I uh- I do feel like you have been saying to me – you’re not say- giving me advice, but I do feel like you are saying, ""You really wanna- You know what pattern you want to follow Gloria, and go ahead and follow it."" I sort of feel a backing up from you."
Therapist,"I guess the way I sense it is uh, you've been telling me that you know what you want to do and yes, I do believe in backing up people in what they want to do. It’s just a little different slant than the way it seems to you."
Patient,Are you telling me...
Therapist,"You see, one thing that concerns me is uh,.. It's no damn good you’re doing something that you haven't really chosen to do. That’s why I am trying to help you find out what your own inner choices are."
Patient,"But then there's also a conflict there because I am not really positive what I wanna do. The lying part, yes, but I am not positive what I wanna do when I go against myself."
Therapist,Sure
Patient,"Like when I bring a man to the house. I am not sure I want to do that. If I feel guilty afterward, I must not have really wanted to."
Therapist,And I am interested that you say - I'm not just sure which words you used - but you don’t want- you don’t like yourself or don't approve of it when you do something against yourself.
Patient,"Yes. You know, this is so different. Now this kind of thing we are talking about now, it isn't just knowing whether you want to do something or not. If I want to go to work in the morning or if I don't want to go to work, that's easy. But when I find myself doing something I don't feel comfortable with, I automatically say, ""If you’re not comfortable Gloria, it’s not right. Something’s wrong."" All right now. What I want to ask you is, how can I know which is the strongest? Because I do it, does that mean that’s the strongest? And yet, if I disapproved, that's just part of the thing that’s got to go along with it? You see, it sounds like you... I'm picking up a contradiction. I’m not under- I’m not following."
Therapist,"It sounds like you’re feeling a contradiction in yourself too, although you- what I heard you saying in part is uh, the way you like it is when you feel really comfortable about what you are doing."
Patient,"Yes, and I have at times, when I’ve made a decision. Now that seems right. That seems perfectly right - no conflict - but then there are times I do things that I feel uncomfortable with. So that there is a conflict there. It's not the same at all. So, what I'm saying is, how do I really know when I am following my true feelings, if I have conflicts afterwards or guilt afterwards?"
Therapist,"I see. Because in the moment, it may seem like your true feelings."
Patient,Yes. Like if I’m starting to do it -- O.K.
Therapist,"Mhm. Mhm. So that really is tough ah ... When if you feel comfortable in the moment about it, but then afterwards don't feel at all comfortable, which course of action was really the one you should have followed?"
Patient,"You know, the most outstanding thing - I don't know if you are following me, when I say about this conflict - the one thing I know is I’ve wanted, for example, to leave my husband for quite a few years. I never did it. I kept thinking how nice it would be, or how scary it would be, but I never did it. And all of a sudden when I did, it felt right. I didn't feel mean toward him. I just knew this was what I had to do. That's when I know I am following myself. I am following my feelings completely. I have no conflict there. Some unhappy things came from it"
Therapist,sure
Patient,"but I still have no conflict. That, to me, is when I am following my feelings. And in everyday life the small little decisions, the small little things to do don't come out that clear at all. So many conflicts come with them."
Therapist,"Mhm, that’s right"
Patient,Is this natural?
Therapist,"Although you are saying – uh, I expect it is – but, but you’re saying too that you know perfectly well the feeling within yourself that occurs when you are really doing something that's right for you."
Patient,I do. I do. And I miss that feeling other times. And it's right away a clue to me.
Therapist,"Mhm. You can really listen to yourself sometimes and realize, ""Oh no, this isn't the right feeling. This isn't – this isn’t the way I would feel if I was doing what I really wanted to do."""
Patient,"But yet, many times I will go along and do it anyway. And say, ""Oh well, I'm in the situation now, I'll just remember next time."" I mentioned this word a lot in therapy and most therapists grin at me or giggle or something when I say ""utopia,"" but when I do follow a feeling and I feel this good feeling inside of me, that's sort of utopia. That's what I mean. That's the way I like to feel whether it's a bad thing or a good thing. But I feel right about me. This is what I wanna..."
Therapist,"I, I sense that in those utopian moments, you really feel kind of whole. You feel all in one piece."
Patient,"Yes. Yeah, it gives me a choked up feeling when you say that because I don't get that as often as I'd like. haha. I like that whole feeling. That's real precious to me."
Therapist,"I expect none of us get it as often as we'd like, but I really do understand it. Mhm, that really does touch you, doesn't it?"
Patient,"Yeah, and you know what else I was just thinking? I – I feel dumb saying it uh - that all of a sudden while I was talking to you I thought, ""Gee, how nice I can talk to you and I want you to approve of me and I respect you, but I miss that my father couldn't talk to me like you are."" I mean, I'd like to say, ""Gee, I'd like you for my father."" I don't even know why that came to me. haha."
Therapist,You look to me like a pretty nice daughter. But you really do miss the fact that you- you couldn't be open with your own dad.
Patient,"Yeah, I couldn't be open, but I, I wanna blame it on him. I think I’m more open than he'd allow me. He would never listen to me talk like you are and not disapprove, not lower me down. I thought of this the other day. Why do I always have to be so perfect? I know why. He always wanted me to be perfect. I always had to be better and uh... yeah, I miss that."
Therapist,"You were just trying like hell to be the girl he wanted you to be. C59 Yet at the same time, rebelling."
Therapist,That's right. Sure.
Patient,"Like I almost gloated writing him a letter the other day and telling him I am a waitress, which I expect him to disapprove of. I go out at nights and I almost gloated hitting him back - like, ""Now how do you like me?"" And yet, I really want acceptance and love from him. I mean, I know he loves me."
Therapist,"So you slap at him and say, ""This is what I am, now see."""
Patient,Yeah.
Therapist,But you- yeah
Patient,"""You raised me, how do you like it?"" But do you know what I want him to say? ""I knew this was you all along, honey, and I really love you."""
Therapist,"Oh, I see. You really feel badly that you think there is very little chance he will say that."
Patient,"No. He won't. He doesn't hear. I went back home to him about two years ago, really wanting to let him know I loved him although I’ve been afraid of him. And he doesn't hear me. He just keeps saying things like, ""Honey, you know I love you. You know I have always loved you."" He doesn't hear."
Therapist,"That was... He’s never really known you and loved you and this, somehow, is what brings the tears inside."
Patient,"I don't know what it is. You know, when I talk about it, it feels more flip. If I just sit still a minute, it feels like a great big hurt down there. That I uh, feel cheated."
Therapist,"Mhm. Mhm. It is much eas... It’s much easier to uh be a little flip, because then you don't feel that big lump inside of hurt."
Patient,"Mhm. And again, that's a hopeless situation. I tried working on it, and uh, I feel it's something I have to accept. My father just isn't the type of man I'd really like. I'd like somebody more understanding and caring. He cares, but not in the way that we can cooperate or communicate."
Therapist,"Mhm. You feel “nope” that, ""I am permanently cheated."""
Patient,"Mhm. That is why I like substitutes. Like I like talking to you and I like men that I can respect. Doctors, and I keep sort of maybe underneath a feeling like we’re real close, you know, and it’s sort of like a substitute father."
Therapist,I don't feel that's pretending.
Patient,"Well, you are not really my father hahaha."
Therapist,"No, I meant about the real close business."
Patient,"Well, see, I sort of feel that's pretending too, because I can't expect you to feel very close to me. You don't know me that well."
Therapist,"Well, all I can do is what I am feeling- that is I feel close to you in this moment."
Patient,"[The remainder is not on the film – only on audio recording] Well, O.K., I'd just like more of it I guess."
Therapist,"Do you feel as though that's a big need, that it would take a lot of caring and a lot of understanding to fill it up?"
Patient,Exactly. And I have been so busy trying to get rid of my neurosis. I'd like to have this one neurosis filled. I'd like to just find someone who is going to love me like a father. I even want this in boyfriends. I always want to get an older man that's caring and more mature and not so flip.
Therapist,"One of the things you really deeply want is to find a father whom you would love and respect and who would really like you as you are, and not to just like perfection."
Patient,"That's right. And it seems ironic that since I have been away from my husband, the only type of man I go out with are the kind I don't respect - are the young, flip, not caring, 'smart aleck' kind of guy. Not somebody that's really, you know, that I can respect. That seems like such a big thing."
Therapist,"The phrase that comes to my mind - I don't know if it is appropriate or not - you're slapping your father in the face, aren't you?"
Patient,Oh? By wanting mature men?
Therapist,No. By going out with those who are quite unlike the ones you'd really want.
Patient,But I don't mean to. I don't understand why they keep coming around.
